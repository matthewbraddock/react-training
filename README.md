# React Frontend Training Repository

A hands-on learning repository focused on mastering React, TypeScript, and modern frontend development practices through practical examples and comparisons.

## Goals

- **React Mastery**: Deep dive into React concepts, hooks, state management, and component patterns
- **TypeScript Proficiency**: Strengthen type-safe development practices=
- **Modern Frontend Tooling**: Experience with Vite, Material-UI, and contemporary build tools
- **Future BFF Integration**: Eventually connect frontend with Backend-for-Frontend services

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for component library
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **ESLint** for code quality
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Navigation

The main App.tsx provides a simple navigation system to explore different examples:

- **Menu View**: Overview of all available examples
- **Example Views**: Individual implementations with back navigation
- **Material-UI Integration**: Clean, professional UI components

## Learning Focus Areas

### React Fundamentals

- Component composition and props
- State management approaches (useState, Context)
- Event handling and navigation patterns
- Conditional rendering

### Advanced Patterns

- Context API vs prop drilling trade-offs
- Component composition strategies
- TypeScript integration best practices
- Material-UI component usage

### TypeScript Integration

- Type-safe component props
- Generic components
- Advanced type patterns
- API response typing

### Future: BFF Integration

- API layer design
- Data fetching patterns
- Error handling
- Authentication flows

## Development Philosophy

Each example demonstrates:

- **Problem**: What challenge does this pattern solve?
- **Solution**: How does the implementation work?
- **Trade-offs**: When to use each approach
- **Learning Points**: Key takeaways and insights discovered

This repository serves as a practical playground for experimenting with React patterns and building production-ready frontend skills through comparative examples.

## Notes

This is a living repository focused on continuous learning and improvement. Solutions and patterns will evolve over time as new techniques are discovered and understood. Early examples may not represent the most optimal approaches, but rather document the learning journey and progression of understanding React concepts and best practices.
